## About the Project
This project will allow users to search recipes using keywords and save recipes that they like. The project uses the Edamam API to search recipes, but the user may also manually input recipes. Using saved and generated recipes, when prompted, the program will be able to produce a meal plan for the user when given parameters such as daily calorie limit. Once a mealplan is generated and the user approves, the program will produce a shopping list for the user.

This project is currently in progress. An SRS document and design document are being being produced to practice the 7 stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC).
